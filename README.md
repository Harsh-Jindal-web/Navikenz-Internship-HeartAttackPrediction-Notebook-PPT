# Heart Attack Prediction - Navikenz Internship

This project is part of an internship at **Navikenz** and aims to analyze and predict the likelihood of heart attacks using machine learning models. The notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), applies classification algorithms, and evaluates their performance using a dataset of patient medical records.
